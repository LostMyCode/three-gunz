GunZ was an online TPS game created by MAIET.

## Just a curiosity

GunZ source code was leaked around 2007 (The coding lang was mostly c++)

and then many devs made some tools, private servers, etc...

I did too when around 2012 - 2016

But now what I want to do is... **Implementing GunZ on web**

# Demo(s)

Here is some demos in my project.
